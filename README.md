## Canto Online Hackathon | Chapter 1, Season 8 | June 19 - July 21

[**Apply to Hack**](https://eugnmr538db.typeform.com/to/BCe0ZX8H)  

The Canto Online Hackathon (COH) is a virtual summit that invites developers, creatives, and communicators to launch the next wave of apps, infrastructure, and original work on Canto. 

## **About Canto**

Canto is a permissionless blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK that offers an EVM execution layer and core financial primitives, including a novel decentralized exchange, lending market, and unit of account (NOTE). 

Since launch, core development on Canto continues, spearheaded by the Canto Protocol Improvement Cluster (CPIC). Released earlier this year, Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) offers a new source of revenue for smart contract developers, while features yet to hit the chain including streamlined bridging and a native liquid staking protocol.

In support of Canto’s Free Public Infrastructure – a framework that advocates for DeFi primitives to be provided as public utilities, among other tenets – the COH encourages projects centered on sustainability, authenticity, and creativity.

## **Submission Requirements**

Submissions to the Canto Online Hackathon should consist of a **pull request to this repo** and a **pre-recorded video**. Make sure to complete both before 11:59pm UTC on 7/21.

**For the PR**, fork this repository and create a new folder named after your project. Inside the folder, include a `README.md` file with a short 2-3 sentence overview of your project. Where applicable, also include links to your frontend deployment and a GitHub repository with the project's source code. See the [example submission](/Example%20Submission/) for reference.

Building in public is encouraged. However, if you wish to keep your source code private, please contact hackathon organizers to ensure judges' GitHub handles are added to your repository.

Submit your PR to the `main` branch. *Do not modify the root `README.md` file in your PR.*

**For the pre-recorded video**, use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record a video (max 3 minutes) about your project, following these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ROIdoGOL9zmSGpq9081uQ3t0HH1WNlObn5HREgoP4Pk/edit?usp=sharing).

This video will be played during the live judging ceremony and can be a working demo and/or a presentation outlining the project (i.e. what was accomplished during the COH, what’s next). For examples of hackathon presentation videos please review the [judging ceremony](https://youtu.be/inbF96BadPA?t=1923) from a previous COH season.
