**For the PR**, fork this repository and create a new folder named after your project. Inside the folder, include a `README.md` file with a short 2-3 sentence overview of your project. Where applicable, also include links to your frontend deployment and a GitHub repository with the project's source code. See the [example submission](/Example%20Submission/) for reference.

Building in public is encouraged. However, if you wish to keep your source code private, please contact hackathon organizers to ensure judges' GitHub handles are added to your repository.

Submit your PR to the `main` branch. *Do not modify the root `README.md` file in your PR.*

**For the pre-recorded video**, use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record a video (max 3 minutes) about your project, following these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ROIdoGOL9zmSGpq9081uQ3t0HH1WNlObn5HREgoP4Pk/edit?usp=sharing).

This video will be played during the live judging ceremony and can be a working demo and/or a presentation outlining the project (i.e. what was accomplished during the COH, what’s next). For examples of hackathon presentation videos please review the [judging ceremony](https://youtu.be/inbF96BadPA?t=1923) from a previous COH season.
